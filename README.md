## 🚀 Why Akkuea?

### The Problem

- 📚 **Scattered Resources**: Educational content is fragmented across platforms, making it hard to find and reuse.
- 🖼️ **Low Quality**: Many resources suffer from poor visuals or organization.
- 💸 **Lack of Incentives**: Educators and creators often go unrewarded for their efforts.
- 🌐 **Language Barriers**: Content is often limited to major languages.
- 🔒 **Proprietary Platforms**: Closed systems prioritize profit over impact.

### Our Solution

- **Centralized Hub**: A single platform with intelligent filters for educational content by level, language, and format.
- **AI-Powered Enhancement**: Automatic improvements to readability, visuals, and structure.
- **Transparent Rewards**: A **Stellar blockchain-based token system** that fairly rewards contributions.
- **Global Access**: Automatic translations, multi-format resources, and device compatibility.
- **Creator Marketplace**: Connect directly with designers for personalized resources, paid in tokens.
