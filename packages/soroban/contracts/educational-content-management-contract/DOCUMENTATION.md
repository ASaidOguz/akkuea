## Events

The contract emits the following events:

1. `PUBLISH` - When new educational content is published

   - Data: content_id, creator, title, creation_timestamp

2. `UPVOTE` - When content receives an upvote

   - Data: content_id, voter, new_upvote_count

3. `VERIFY` - When content is verified
   - Data: content_id, verifier, verification_timestamp

## Data Structures

### Content

Stores comprehensive information about educational content:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the content
- `creator`: Address of the content creator
- `title`: Title of the educational content
- `content_hash`: Hash reference to the actual content (stored elsewhere)
- `creation_date`: Timestamp when the content was created
- `subject_tags`: Categories/topics for the content
- `upvotes`: Counter for community endorsements
- `is_verified`: Verification status of the content

## Functions

### Content Publishing

#### `publish_content(env: Env, creator: Address, title: String, content_hash: BytesN<32>, subject_tags: Vec<String>) -> u64`

- Publishes new educational content with metadata
- Parameters:
  - `creator`: The address of the content creator
  - `title`: The title of the educational content
  - `content_hash`: Hash reference to the actual content
  - `subject_tags`: Categories/topics for the content
- Returns the unique content ID
- Requires authentication from the creator
- Emits `PUBLISH` event

### Content Upvoting

#### `upvote_content(env: Env, content_id: u64, voter: Address) -> u32`

- Upvotes educational content
- Parameters:
  - `content_id`: The unique identifier of the content
  - `voter`: The address of the user upvoting the content
- Returns the new upvote count
- Prevents duplicate votes from the same user
- Requires authentication from the voter
- Emits `UPVOTE` event

### Content Verification

#### `verify_content(env: Env, content_id: u64, verifier: Address) -> bool`

- Verifies the accuracy and quality of educational content
- Parameters:
  - `content_id`: The unique identifier of the content
  - `verifier`: The address of the verifier
- Returns true if verification was successful
- Requires authentication from the verifier
- Emits `VERIFY` event

### Content Retrieval

#### `get_content(env: Env, content_id: u64) -> Content`

- Retrieves detailed information about educational content
- Parameters:
  - `content_id`: The unique identifier of the content
- Returns the complete content data structure
- Panics if the content does not exist

### Advanced Content Filtering

#### `filter_by_verification(env: Env) -> Vec<Content>`
- Filters and retrieves only verified educational content
- Parameters: None
- Returns a vector of all content items where `is_verified == true`
- This is a view-only function that does not modify contract state
- Returns an empty vector if no verified content exists
- Useful for discovering trusted, quality-assured educational materials

**Usage Example:**
```rust
// Get all verified content
let verified_content = client.filter_by_verification();

// Process verified content
for i in 0..verified_content.len() {
    let content = verified_content.get(i).unwrap();
    // Use verified content...
}
```

#### `filter_by_min_upvotes(env: Env, min_upvotes: u32) -> Vec<Content>`
- Filters and retrieves content with upvotes greater than or equal to the minimum threshold
- Parameters:
  - `min_upvotes`: The minimum number of upvotes required (inclusive)
- Returns a vector of all content items where `upvotes >= min_upvotes`
- This is a view-only function that does not modify contract state
- Returns an empty vector if no content meets the upvote threshold
- Useful for discovering popular, community-endorsed educational content

**Usage Examples:**
```rust
// Get content with at least 10 upvotes (popular content)
let popular_content = client.filter_by_min_upvotes(&10);

// Get content with at least 5 upvotes (moderately popular)
let moderately_popular = client.filter_by_min_upvotes(&5);

// Get all content (including those with 0 upvotes)
let all_content = client.filter_by_min_upvotes(&0);

// Process popular content
for i in 0..popular_content.len() {
    let content = popular_content.get(i).unwrap();
    // Use popular content...
}
```

**Combining Filters:**
While the contract provides individual filter functions, clients can combine their results to find content that meets multiple criteria:

```rust
// Get verified content
let verified_content = client.filter_by_verification();

// Get popular content (10+ upvotes)
let popular_content = client.filter_by_min_upvotes(&10);

// Find content that is both verified AND popular
// (This would be done client-side by finding intersection of results)
```
