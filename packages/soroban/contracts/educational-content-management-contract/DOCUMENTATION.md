# Educational Content Management Contract Documentation

## Overview

The Educational Content Management Contract is a Soroban-based smart contract built for the Stellar blockchain that enables a decentralized platform for educational content within the Akkuea ecosystem. This contract allows users to publish educational materials, upvote valuable content, verify content accuracy and quality, and track content popularity through a transparent and immutable system.

The contract serves as a foundation for Akkuea's educational marketplace, ensuring that educational content is properly attributed, verified, and valued by the community. By maintaining a transparent record of content creation, verification, and popularity, the contract facilitates trust between content creators and learners while incentivizing high-quality educational contributions.

## Events

The contract emits the following events:

1. `PUBLISH` - When new educational content is published
   - Data: content_id, creator, title, creation_timestamp

2. `UPVOTE` - When content receives an upvote
   - Data: content_id, voter, new_upvote_count

3. `VERIFY` - When content is verified
   - Data: content_id, verifier, verification_timestamp

## Data Structures

### Content
Stores comprehensive information about educational content:
- `id`: Unique identifier for the content
- `creator`: Address of the content creator
- `title`: Title of the educational content
- `content_hash`: Hash reference to the actual content (stored elsewhere)
- `creation_date`: Timestamp when the content was created
- `subject_tags`: Categories/topics for the content
- `upvotes`: Counter for community endorsements
- `is_verified`: Verification status of the content

## Functions

### Content Publishing

#### `publish_content(env: Env, creator: Address, title: String, content_hash: BytesN<32>, subject_tags: Vec<String>) -> u64`
- Publishes new educational content with metadata
- Parameters:
  - `creator`: The address of the content creator
  - `title`: The title of the educational content
  - `content_hash`: Hash reference to the actual content
  - `subject_tags`: Categories/topics for the content
- Returns the unique content ID
- Requires authentication from the creator
- Emits `PUBLISH` event

### Content Upvoting

#### `upvote_content(env: Env, content_id: u64, voter: Address) -> u32`
- Upvotes educational content
- Parameters:
  - `content_id`: The unique identifier of the content
  - `voter`: The address of the user upvoting the content
- Returns the new upvote count
- Prevents duplicate votes from the same user
- Requires authentication from the voter
- Emits `UPVOTE` event

### Content Verification

#### `verify_content(env: Env, content_id: u64, verifier: Address) -> bool`
- Verifies the accuracy and quality of educational content
- Parameters:
  - `content_id`: The unique identifier of the content
  - `verifier`: The address of the verifier
- Returns true if verification was successful
- Requires authentication from the verifier
- Emits `VERIFY` event

### Content Retrieval

#### `get_content(env: Env, content_id: u64) -> Content`
- Retrieves detailed information about educational content
- Parameters:
  - `content_id`: The unique identifier of the content
- Returns the complete content data structure
- Panics if the content does not exist

## Technical Details and Implementation Notes

1. **Data Model**
